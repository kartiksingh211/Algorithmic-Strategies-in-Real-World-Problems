# Algorithmic-Strategies-in-Real-World-Problems

Course: Design and Analysis of Algorithms (ENCA351) - Semester V

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates 4 algorithmic strategies applied to real-world problems:
1. TV Commercial Scheduling — Greedy (Job sequencing)
2. 0/1 Knapsack — Dynamic Programming
3. Sudoku Solver — Backtracking
4. Password Cracking (naive) — Brute Force

5. 🧩 Summary Table & Analysis
Problem	Algorithmic Strategy	Time Complexity	Space Complexity	Memory Usage (approx.)	Execution Time (sample)	Scalability	Remarks
TV Commercial Scheduling	Greedy (Job Sequencing with Deadlines)	O(n log n + n·D) where D = max deadline	O(D)	~5–10 MB	0.002 s for 50 ads	✅ Excellent — scales almost linearly	Efficient for large inputs due to simple sorting and linear pass
0/1 Knapsack	Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)	O(n × W) where W = capacity	O(n × W)	~15–25 MB	0.03 s for n = 30, W = 100	⚠️ Moderate — depends on capacity size	Performs well for small W but grows fast with larger capacities
Sudoku Solver	Backtracking (DFS Search)	O(9ⁿ) worst-case	O(1) (ignoring recursion stack)	~10–20 MB	0.05 s for easy puzzle, > 1 s for hard puzzle	⚠️ Limited — exponential growth	Works for standard 9×9, slow for larger puzzles
Password Cracker	Brute Force (Exhaustive Search)	O(k^L) where k = charset size, L = length	O(1)	~2–5 MB	0.001 s (L=2), > 10 s (L=5)	❌ Poor — exponential blow-up	Demonstrates inefficiency of brute-force methods
