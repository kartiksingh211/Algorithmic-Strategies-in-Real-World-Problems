# Algorithmic-Strategies-in-Real-World-Problems

Course: Design and Analysis of Algorithms (ENCA351) - Semester V

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates 4 algorithmic strategies applied to real-world problems:
1. TV Commercial Scheduling — Greedy (Job sequencing)
2. 0/1 Knapsack — Dynamic Programming
3. Sudoku Solver — Backtracking
4. Password Cracking (naive) — Brute Force

## How to run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Create & activate Python virtual environment:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
3. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Launch Jupyter:
   jupyter notebook
5. Open `algo_strategies_notebook.ipynb` and run cells.
